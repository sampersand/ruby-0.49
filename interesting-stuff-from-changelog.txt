	* parse.y: Changed the syntax to create arrays to [..]. This breaks
	  compatibility with older Ruby scripts, but introducing syntax for Dict and
	  aligning with perl5 made now the only right time to change it.
	  *BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY*


Thu Jun 30 13:51:29 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Removed -f option. It’s a relic from before load existed; no longer needed. -- woah


Fri Jun 24 10:01:28 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Added default output destination. Previously only way was assigning to
	  $stdout. (__r49: IO.default= is this lol)


Fri Jun 17 10:55:08 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Added $ENV as another way to access environment variables aside from
	  getenv()/setenv(). $ENV behaves like a string-to-string dictionary; each
	  returns assoc. (__r49: getenv/setenv came before!)

Thu Jun 16 10:32:23 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Object:attr() - Do not define default accessor methods if already defined.
	  No distinction between accessor and same-named method in Ruby, but oh well.


Tue Jun  7 09:45:31 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Removed "new" which is a C++ keyword. But "class" is also reserved and has
	  no replacement, so left unchanged.

Mon May 30 10:07:42 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Treat right-hand side of operator `!' as conditional expression. This may
	  confuse re-definers but helps most users avoid confusion. (__r49: ???)

Thu Feb 24 16:23:28 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* Changed toint, tofloat, print_string to to_i, to_f, to_s.

Mon Mar  7 17:46:15 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* “&string” form. Removed “expr.string” message-send form.

Wed Feb 16 12:29:12 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* Added "::" operator. a::b is same as {a, b}. a::b::c is {a, {b, c}}
	  (right-associative). Though equivalent, "::" is slightly more memory-
	  efficient.

Wed May 18 01:06:25 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@dyna)

	* until/unless: from operators to control statements. Exception-catching
	  remains.
(AND)

Mon Feb 14 18:24:13 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* unless, until now treat exceptions as false.



----
seems wrong about the `-`:
   open(file[, mode])                                           +

        Opens file and returns a File object.
        If filename begins with `|`, the following string is executed as a command
        and a pipeline is created.

        If the command name is "-", open() creates a Ruby child process and returns
        a pipe to the child.

Array: (huh, does this actually work?)
   delete_if

  Iterator that deletes items when the block, given [key, value], evaluates to true.


String (:LOL)
   next

        Returns the "next" string. Numbers increment as numbers, letters increment as letters, carrying over as necessary.

                "aa".next == "ab"
                "99".next == "100"
                "a9".next == "b0"

        This method is used in Range:each, so the following is possible:

                for i in "a" .. "ba"
                  print(i, "\n");
                end

        Outputs each string from a, b, c, .. aa, .. az, ba.

        Note: The end condition is determined using `==`, not comparison operators. If the right-hand string does not include the next string of the left-hand side, as in the example below, it will loop infinitely:

                for i in "0" .. "1a"
                  print(i, "\n");
                end

        Some may speculate that the author wrote it this way to avoid responsibility. That speculation is correct.


Time: (huh!)
   times

        Returns the accumulated user/system CPU time consumed by the current process
        and its child processes as a structure (see Struct).

    struct tms
      utime # User time of the process
      stime # System time of the process
      cutime  # User time of child processes
      cstime  # System time of child processes
    end
