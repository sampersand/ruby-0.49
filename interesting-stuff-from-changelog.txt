	* parse.y: Changed the syntax to create arrays to [..]. This breaks
	  compatibility with older Ruby scripts, but introducing syntax for Dict and
	  aligning with perl5 made now the only right time to change it.
	  *BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY*

	* Removed -f option. It’s a relic from before load existed; no longer needed. -- woah


Fri Jun 24 10:01:28 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Added default output destination. Previously only way was assigning to
	  $stdout. (__r49: IO.default= is this lol)


Fri Jun 17 10:55:08 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Added $ENV as another way to access environment variables aside from
	  getenv()/setenv(). $ENV behaves like a string-to-string dictionary; each
	  returns assoc. (__r49: getenv/setenv came before!)

Thu Jun 16 10:32:23 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Object:attr() - Do not define default accessor methods if already defined.
	  No distinction between accessor and same-named method in Ruby, but oh well.


Tue Jun  7 09:45:31 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Removed "new" which is a C++ keyword. But "class" is also reserved and has
	  no replacement, so left unchanged.

Mon May 30 10:07:42 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@ix-02)

	* Treat right-hand side of operator `!' as conditional expression. This may
	  confuse re-definers but helps most users avoid confusion. (__r49: ???)

Thu Feb 24 16:23:28 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* Changed toint, tofloat, print_string to to_i, to_f, to_s.

Mon Mar  7 17:46:15 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* “&string” form. Removed “expr.string” message-send form.

Wed Feb 16 12:29:12 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* Added "::" operator. a::b is same as {a, b}. a::b::c is {a, {b, c}}
	  (right-associative). Though equivalent, "::" is slightly more memory-
	  efficient.

Wed May 18 01:06:25 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz@dyna)

	* until/unless: from operators to control statements. Exception-catching
	  remains.
(AND)

Mon Feb 14 18:24:13 1994  Yukihiro Matsumoto  (matz at nws119)

	* unless, until now treat exceptions as false.
